				<h1> Welcome to Alchemythology</h1> 

			<p> You may be wondering to yourself "What is the meaning of life?" "Did I eat breakfast this morning?" "What is Alchemythology?" 
			or "Why is this website talking to me as if it's a person?". Well, lucky for you I have the answer to exactly one of those questions. </p>

			<p> Alchemythology (al-chem-myth-ology) is a combination of the words alchemy and mythology, and refers to the combination of mythical creatures with the purpose of creating something new, unique and oftentimes ridiculous. Using this website you can become an Alchemythologist, without any training or certification required, just click on the builder button below to try your hand at creating your own mythological monstrosity, or if you're feeling a little more wild, you can click the randomizer button, which will take two random creatures and fuse them into a captivating combination of catastrophic confusion.</p>
